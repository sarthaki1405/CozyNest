# Pomodoro Timer with Ambience created to focus on studies

A web-based Pomodoro timer application that helps you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This application includes a 25-minute work timer, a 5-minute break timer, and various ambient sounds to create the perfect working environment.
This website is also inspired by the websites that I have used: lofi.cafe and Noisili.
